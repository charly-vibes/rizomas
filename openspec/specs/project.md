# Project: Explorable Essays on LLM Mechanics

## Purpose
This project is a collection of 17 interconnected visual essays ("plateaus") about how LLMs work, aimed at a general audience. The goal is to create a non-linear, explorable experience that helps non-technical people understand the core mechanics and best practices of using language models.

## Core Philosophy

### The Rhizome Structure
Rather than a linear textbook or a tree-structured curriculum, the essays form a **rhizome** (Deleuze & Guattari) — a network of interconnected nodes with no privileged entry point, no hierarchy, and no predetermined path. Each essay is a **plateau**: a self-contained zone of intensity that connects laterally to others.

This means:
- **No "start here"**: Any essay can be the first one.
- **No depth hierarchy**: "Simple" and "complex" are adjacent territories, not vertical layers.
- **Multiple entry points per concept**: An idea can be entered through a metaphor, an interactive, or a prompt-engineering exercise.
- **Lines of flight**: Tangents are not distractions; they are the primary mode of exploration, allowing the reader to follow their curiosity.

### The Central Tension
The essays orbit a productive contradiction:
> LLMs are glorified autocomplete — AND — they are not simply glorified autocomplete.

The goal is not to resolve this tension, but to give readers the tools to hold both ideas simultaneously and understand when each framing is useful.

### Crystallization, Not Tunnels
To handle progressive depth, we reject the "tunnel" metaphor (of going "down" into darkness) in favor of **crystallization** (Simondon). Content "grows outward" from a **seed** concept, revealing different **facets** of the same idea.

- The **Seed** is the surface concept, a compact and accessible statement.
- **Crystallization** is the process of the reader engaging with a seed, causing structure to propagate outward.
- **Facets** are the different angles of an idea that are revealed (e.g., mathematical, historical, practical, philosophical).

This interaction model is one of expansion and revelation, not descent. The UI should reflect this, with content growing outward from nucleation points.
