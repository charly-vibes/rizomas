## 1. Audit & Inventory
- [ ] 1.1 Compile a complete jargon inventory: list every acronym and technical term used across all 17 plateaus
- [ ] 1.2 Categorize each term as **essential** (cannot be simplified) or **replaceable** (simpler alternative exists)
- [ ] 1.3 Write plain-language definitions for all essential terms

## 2. Acronym Expansion
- [ ] 2.1 Ensure every acronym is expanded on first use within each plateau (e.g., "RLHF (Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback)")
- [ ] 2.2 For acronyms used across multiple plateaus, expand on first use per plateau (readers may enter at any point)

## 3. Glossary Mechanism
- [ ] 3.1 Design a glossary-seed pattern: reuse the existing inline-seed affordance (dotted underline + background) for technical term definitions
- [ ] 3.2 Implement glossary seeds for all essential terms that lack an existing explanatory seed
- [ ] 3.3 Ensure glossary seeds are keyboard accessible and screen-reader announced

## 4. Plain Language Pass
- [ ] 4.1 Replace all replaceable terms with simpler alternatives
- [ ] 4.2 Review step text for unnecessarily complex sentence structures
- [ ] 4.3 Assess overall readability using a heuristic (e.g., Flesch-Kincaid or manual review)

## 5. Validation
- [ ] 5.1 Verify all acronyms are expanded on first use in each plateau
- [ ] 5.2 Verify all essential technical terms have a glossary seed or existing explanatory seed
- [ ] 5.3 Manual review: read each plateau as a non-technical reader and flag remaining confusion points
