# Proposal: Implement Dwell-Reveal Annotations

## Problem
The "Dwell-Reveal Annotations" feature, as described in the `navigation` spec, is not implemented.

## Proposed Solution
Implement the "Dwell-Reveal Annotations" feature, which displays a subtle annotation in the margin when the reader holds their cursor still over a paragraph for 3 or more seconds.
