# Proposal: Implement Scrollytelling for "Echoes Of The Past"

## Problem
The `#/echoes-of-the-past` plateau is not implemented as a scrollytelling experience. It is currently a simple page with expandable buttons. The `plateaus` spec describes a detailed scrollytelling experience with visual states that progress as the user scrolls.

## Proposed Solution
Implement the scrollytelling functionality for "Echoes Of The Past" plateau as described in the `plateaus` spec. This will involve creating the visual states and connecting them to the scroll position.
