# Proposal: Implement Liminal Transitions

## Problem
The "Liminal Transitions" feature, as described in the `navigation` spec, is not implemented. When navigating between plateaus, the transition is instantaneous.

## Proposed Solution
Implement the "Liminal Transitions" feature, which displays a transitional moment lasting 500ms--1s when navigating between plateaus.
