# Proposal: Implement Cross-Plateau Retrieval Moments

## Problem
The "Cross-Plateau Retrieval Moments" feature, as described in the `navigation` spec, is not implemented.

## Proposed Solution
Implement the "Cross-Plateau Retrieval Moments" feature, which displays a brief interstitial retrieval moment when entering a new plateau after the reader has visited 3 or more plateaus.
