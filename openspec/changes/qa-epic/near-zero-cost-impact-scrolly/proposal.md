# Proposal: Implement Scrollytelling for "Near Zero Cost Impact"

## Problem
The `#/near-zero-cost-impact` plateau is not implemented as a scrollytelling experience. It is currently a simple page with expandable buttons. The `plateaus` spec describes a detailed scrollytelling experience with visual states that progress as the user scrolls.

## Proposed Solution
Implement the scrollytelling functionality for "Near Zero Cost Impact" plateau as described in the `plateaus` spec. This will involve creating the visual states and connecting them to the scroll position.
