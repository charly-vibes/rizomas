# Proposal: Implement Scrollytelling for "Automation Of Cognition"

## Problem
The `#/automation-of-cognition` plateau is not implemented as a scrollytelling experience. It is currently a simple page with expandable buttons. The `plateaus` spec describes a detailed scrollytelling experience with visual states that progress as the user scrolls.

## Proposed Solution
Implement the scrollytelling functionality for "Automation Of Cognition" plateau as described in the `plateaus` spec. This will involve creating the visual states and connecting them to the scroll position.
