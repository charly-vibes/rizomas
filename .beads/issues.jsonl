It doesn't invite exploration or convey the rhizomatic spirit of the project.\n\n### Current behavior\n- Static canvas rendering with hard-edged black filled/outline circles\n- Sharp straight-line edges with binary opacity\n- No animation, no breathing, no sense of life\n- Fixed box with plain border, no visual feedback on hover\n- On plateaus, shows only local connections — loses the larger-network feeling\n\n### Desired behavior\nThe mini-map should feel like a living organism — a quiet, ambient companion that breathes and responds gently. It should evoke constellations or neural networks, not a data visualization.\n\n### Implementation phases (priority order)\n\n**Phase 1 — Visual softening (minimum viable)**\n- Soft rendering: reduced contrast, ink3/ink4 palette, softer node edges\n- Organic edges: quadratic curves instead of straight lines\n- You-are-here presence: current node distinguished with subtle glow\n\n**Phase 2 — Ambient life**\n- Breathing animation: nodes gently pulse (4–6s cycle, ±0.1 opacity)\n- Trail visualization: faint path showing reader's journey\n\n**Phase 3 — Interaction polish**\n- Gentle hover response: mini-map subtly brightens on hover\n- Smooth transitions: view morphs between plateaus instead of snapping\n\n### Acceptance criteria\n- [ ] Node rendering uses ink3/ink4 range — no hard black fills\n- [ ] Edges use quadratic bezier curves, not straight lines\n- [ ] Active node on plateaus has a soft glow or pulse distinguishing it\n- [ ] Breathing animation cycle is 4–6s with max ±0.1 opacity delta\n- [ ] `prefers-reduced-motion: reduce` disables all animation entirely\n- [ ] Animation holds steady 60fps (no jank on low-end devices)\n- [ ] Accessibility: canvas remains `aria-hidden`, button keeps `aria-label`\n- [ ] Visual before/after screenshots reviewed before merge\n\n### Related issues\n- rizomas-0s2: Redundant Navigation Map Modal (resolve overlay behavior before Phase 3)\n- rizomas-661: Accessible fallback for canvas navigation (must not regress)\n\n### Related spec\n- openspec/specs/navigation/spec.md → Requirement: Rhizome Mini-Map\n- Current spec is purely functional. UX quality and animation are a gap.\n\n### Notes\nThis is about the *feeling*, not functionality.
