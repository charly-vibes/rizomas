{"id":"rizomas-71q","title":"Mini-map: hover interaction and smooth plateau transitions","description":"Phase 3 of rizomas-c1l. Interaction polish for the mini-map.\n\n### Design rationale\nThe rhizome has no fixed center — moving through it should feel continuous, not like jumping between disconnected snapshots. Smooth transitions honor the rhizomatic principle of connection: every point can and should connect to every other. The hover brightening is an invitation — the network responds to the reader's attention.\n\n### Architectural prerequisite\nCurrently `buildMiniMap` is recreated from scratch on each route change (destroyed and rebuilt in `renderRoute`). Smooth transitions between plateau contexts are impossible with this lifecycle — there is no persistent instance to animate. **Before implementing this phase**, refactor buildMiniMap to persist across route changes, accepting state updates via a method (e.g., `miniMap.updateContext(newCurrentId, newState)`) rather than being rebuilt.\n\n### Changes\n\n1. **Lifecycle refactor**: Refactor buildMiniMap to return a persistent object with an `updateContext(currentId, state)` method. The container and canvas persist in the DOM; only the rendered content changes.\n2. **Hover response**: On mouseenter, the mini-map border SHALL transition to `--ink3` over 0.2s. On mouseleave, revert. Use CSS transition (not canvas redraw).\n3. **Smooth transitions**: When `updateContext` is called with a new currentId, crossfade between old and new highlightIds/edgeFilter over 0.3s (per visual-design motion timings). Technique: render old state at decreasing opacity while rendering new state at increasing opacity on a second canvas, or use a single canvas with interpolated state.\n\n### Acceptance criteria\n- [ ] buildMiniMap persists across route changes (not rebuilt)\n- [ ] Hover produces border transition to `--ink3` over 0.2s\n- [ ] Transition between plateau contexts crossfades over 0.3s (no hard snap)\n- [ ] prefers-reduced-motion disables transition animation (instant swap)\n- [ ] Does not conflict with overlay open behavior (rizomas-0s2)\n- [ ] Cleanup method properly tears down persistent instance\n\n### Dependencies\n- Blocked by rizomas-c0x (Phase 1 — soft rendering foundation)\n- Blocked by rizomas-niv (Phase 2 — animation loop to integrate with)\n- Should consider rizomas-0s2 resolution (overlay behavior)\n\n### Spec reference\n- Openspec change: update-minimap-aesthetics (must be approved before implementation)\n- visual-design motion timings: Mini-map context transition = 0.3s, hover brighten = 0.2s","status":"closed","priority":3,"issue_type":"task","owner":"charly.vibes@proton.me","created_at":"2026-02-12T19:48:22.687352034-03:00","created_by":"charly vibes","updated_at":"2026-02-13T20:44:54.942171455-03:00","closed_at":"2026-02-13T20:44:54.942171455-03:00","close_reason":"Closed","labels":["navigation","ux"],"dependencies":[{"issue_id":"rizomas-71q","depends_on_id":"rizomas-c0x","type":"blocks","created_at":"2026-02-12T19:48:32.721330938-03:00","created_by":"charly vibes"},{"issue_id":"rizomas-71q","depends_on_id":"rizomas-niv","type":"blocks","created_at":"2026-02-12T19:48:34.259439423-03:00","created_by":"charly vibes"},{"issue_id":"rizomas-71q","depends_on_id":"rizomas-c1l","type":"parent-child","created_at":"2026-02-12T19:48:43.636065634-03:00","created_by":"charly vibes"}]}

{"id":"rizomas-c0x","title":"Mini-map: visual softening (soft palette, curved edges, you-are-here glow)","description":"Phase 1 of rizomas-c1l. Minimum viable redesign of mini-map rendering.\n\n### Design rationale\nThe rhizome is a living structure — it doesn't grow in straight lines or hard edges. Curved edges echo organic growth patterns. Softer rendering for unvisited nodes creates a sense of latent possibility — ideas not yet explored, waiting quietly. The active node's glow is the reader's presence in the network, a consciousness moving through the rhizome.\n\n### Changes to drawGraph / buildMiniMap in index.html\n\n1. **Soft palette for unvisited nodes**: Unvisited nodes render as outlines with `--ink3` stroke and `--paper` fill (not hard black). Visited nodes keep `--ink` dark fill per spec. Edges use `--ink4` at reduced opacity (0.06 for unvisited, 0.25 for visited-adjacent).\n2. **Curved edges**: Add a `curvedEdges` parameter to drawGraph. When true, replace ctx.lineTo with ctx.quadraticCurveTo. Control points offset perpendicular to edge midpoint. Pass `curvedEdges: true` from buildMiniMap only (landing map and overlay unchanged for now).\n3. **You-are-here glow**: On plateaus, the activeId node gets a radial gradient glow (center: `--ink` at 0.9, edge: transparent) extending 3px beyond node radius. Do NOT use ctx.shadowBlur (performance concern on high-DPI canvas). Use ctx.createRadialGradient instead.\n\n### Acceptance criteria\n- [ ] Unvisited nodes render with `--ink3` stroke, `--paper` fill — no hard black\n- [ ] Visited nodes keep `--ink` dark fill (spec-compliant)\n- [ ] All mini-map edges render as quadratic bezier curves\n- [ ] Landing map and overlay edges remain straight (curvedEdges parameter)\n- [ ] Active node has radial gradient glow (no ctx.shadowBlur)\n- [ ] Accessibility attributes unchanged (aria-hidden canvas, aria-label button)\n- [ ] Before/after screenshots captured\n- [ ] Profile canvas rendering on high-DPI — confirm no jank\n\n### Key code locations\n- CSS: index.html L152–179\n- buildMiniMap: index.html L1344–1395\n- drawGraph: index.html L1094–1186\n\n### Spec reference\n- Openspec change: update-minimap-aesthetics (must be approved before implementation)","status":"closed","priority":2,"issue_type":"task","owner":"charly.vibes@proton.me","created_at":"2026-02-12T19:48:02.041225805-03:00","created_by":"charly vibes","updated_at":"2026-02-13T20:44:54.789001832-03:00","closed_at":"2026-02-13T20:44:54.789001832-03:00","close_reason":"Closed","labels":["navigation","ux"],"dependencies":[{"issue_id":"rizomas-c0x","depends_on_id":"rizomas-c1l","type":"parent-child","created_at":"2026-02-12T19:48:40.654721518-03:00","created_by":"charly vibes"}]}
{"id":"rizomas-c1l","title":"Redesign mini-map for calm, exploratory feel","description":"## Problem\n\nThe bottom-right mini-map (160×120px canvas) currently feels utilitarian and static — it renders a flat graph with hard black dots and abrupt lines, then just sits there. It doesn't invite exploration or convey the rhizomatic spirit of the project.\n\n### Design rationale — The rhizome made visible\n\nThe mini-map IS the rhizome — it's the Deleuze/Guattari concept made tangible. Right now it looks like a data visualization. It should feel like a living network, a mycelial web of ideas that breathes and responds to the reader's presence.\n\n- **Curved edges** because rhizomes don't grow in straight lines — they follow organic, opportunistic paths\n- **Soft rendering** because unexplored ideas are latent possibilities, not hard boundaries — they whisper, they don't shout\n- **Breathing animation** because the rhizome is alive — it grows, extends, connects even when you're not looking\n- **You-are-here glow** because the reader is a consciousness moving through the network — their presence matters\n- **Journey trail** because each reader's path is a unique line of flight (Deleuze's 'ligne de fuite') through the rhizome\n- **Smooth transitions** because the rhizome has no center or edge — moving through it should feel continuous, not like jumping between disconnected frames\n\n### Visual coherence note\nThe mini-map, landing page map, and overlay constellation are the same graph at different scales. Phase 1 introduces `curvedEdges` as a parameter to drawGraph, initially scoped to the mini-map only. A follow-up ticket should evaluate harmonizing all three renderings once the aesthetic direction is validated.\n\n### Implementation phases (priority order)\n\n**Phase 1 — Visual softening (rizomas-c0x)**\n- Soft palette: unvisited nodes in ink3/ink4, visited keep ink dark fill (spec-compliant)\n- Curved edges via curvedEdges parameter in drawGraph\n- Active node radial gradient glow (not ctx.shadowBlur)\n\n**Phase 2 — Ambient life (rizomas-niv)**\n- Breathing animation: 5s period, ±0.08 opacity on node fills\n- Visibility-gated via IntersectionObserver (paused when not visible)\n- Journey trail using state.tr chronological order\n\n**Phase 3 — Interaction polish (rizomas-71q)**\n- Architectural prerequisite: refactor buildMiniMap to persist across routes\n- Hover brightening (CSS transition, 0.2s)\n- Smooth plateau-context crossfade (0.3s)\n\n### Acceptance criteria\nSee child tickets for phase-specific criteria. Cross-cutting criteria:\n- [ ] `prefers-reduced-motion: reduce` disables all animation entirely\n- [ ] Steady 60fps on low-end devices\n- [ ] Accessibility: canvas remains `aria-hidden`, button keeps `aria-label`\n- [ ] Visual before/after screenshots reviewed before each phase merges\n- [ ] All new timings registered in visual-design motion timings table\n\n### Spec change required\nOpenspec change `update-minimap-aesthetics` modifies navigation and visual-design specs. Must be approved before implementation begins.\n\n### Related issues\n- rizomas-0s2: Redundant Navigation Map Modal (resolve overlay behavior before Phase 3)\n- rizomas-661: Accessible fallback for canvas navigation (must not regress)\n\n### Related spec\n- openspec/specs/navigation/spec.md → Requirement: Rhizome Mini-Map\n- openspec/specs/visual-design/spec.md → Requirement: Motion Timings","status":"closed","priority":2,"issue_type":"feature","owner":"charly.vibes@proton.me","created_at":"2026-02-12T19:46:04.986367793-03:00","created_by":"charly vibes","updated_at":"2026-02-13T20:44:55.012919242-03:00","closed_at":"2026-02-13T20:44:55.012919242-03:00","close_reason":"Closed","labels":["navigation","ux"],"dependencies":[{"issue_id":"rizomas-c1l","depends_on_id":"rizomas-0s2","type":"related","created_at":"2026-02-12T19:48:48.231575498-03:00","created_by":"charly vibes"},{"issue_id":"rizomas-c1l","depends_on_id":"rizomas-661","type":"related","created_at":"2026-02-12T19:48:48.997451436-03:00","created_by":"charly vibes"}]}

{"id":"rizomas-niv","title":"Mini-map: ambient breathing animation and trail visualization","description":"Phase 2 of rizomas-c1l. Add life to the mini-map with subtle animation.\n\n### Design rationale\nA rhizome is alive — it grows, breathes, extends. The breathing animation makes the mini-map feel like a living organism rather than a static diagram. The trail visualization is the reader's path through the rhizome made visible — their personal line of flight, unique to their reading journey.\n\n### Changes\n\n1. **Breathing animation**: Add a requestAnimationFrame loop to buildMiniMap that redraws the canvas with a slow sinusoidal opacity oscillation on node fills only (not edges — edges at 0.06 opacity would disappear). Cycle: 5s period, ±0.08 opacity delta (registered in visual-design motion timings). Must be imperceptible on first glance — an observer looking at the minimap for under 2 seconds should not consciously notice the animation.\n2. **Visibility gating**: Wrap the rAF loop with an IntersectionObserver on the mini-map container. When not visible (scrolled away, tab backgrounded), pause the loop entirely. On mobile (mini-map collapsed to 44px circle per visual-design breakpoints), disable breathing entirely.\n3. **Trail visualization**: When `state.tr` (chronological trail array, NOT state.v which is unordered) has 2+ entries, draw a faint curved path connecting visited nodes in visit order. Use `--acc` color at 0.2 opacity. Reuse the curvedEdges rendering style from Phase 1.\n\n### Acceptance criteria\n- [ ] Breathing cycle is 5s period with max ±0.08 opacity change on node fills\n- [ ] Breathing applies only to nodes, not edges (min edge opacity stays at 0.06)\n- [ ] IntersectionObserver pauses rAF loop when mini-map not visible\n- [ ] Mobile (≤480px): breathing disabled entirely\n- [ ] prefers-reduced-motion: reduce disables animation entirely (static render)\n- [ ] Steady 60fps — no dropped frames on low-end hardware\n- [ ] Trail path visible when 2+ plateaus visited (uses state.tr, not state.v)\n- [ ] Trail uses `--acc` at 0.2 opacity with curved segments\n- [ ] Animation cleans up properly (cancelAnimationFrame + observer.disconnect) on route change\n\n### Key code locations\n- buildMiniMap: index.html L1344–1395\n- drawGraph trail logic: index.html L1139–1152\n- prefersReducedMotion helper: index.html L1208\n\n### Spec reference\n- Openspec change: update-minimap-aesthetics (must be approved before implementation)\n- visual-design motion timings: Mini-map breathing = 5s period, ±0.08","status":"closed","priority":2,"issue_type":"task","owner":"charly.vibes@proton.me","created_at":"2026-02-12T19:48:12.923226335-03:00","created_by":"charly vibes","updated_at":"2026-02-13T20:44:54.87181803-03:00","closed_at":"2026-02-13T20:44:54.87181803-03:00","close_reason":"Closed","labels":["navigation","ux"],"dependencies":[{"issue_id":"rizomas-niv","depends_on_id":"rizomas-c1l","type":"parent-child","created_at":"2026-02-12T19:48:42.344770369-03:00","created_by":"charly vibes"}]}
